# CI Pipeline – Flutter Android (Debug APK)
# this workflow runs automated quality checks on every code change and produces a downloadable debug APK artifact (simple code)

name: Flutter Android CI

# The pipeline starts automatically when any of these events happen:(trigger)
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]          # Code merged / pushed to the main branch 
    #if want to add branches , then [main, develop, staging etc]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]          # A pull request targeting main
  workflow_dispatch:            # "run workflow" (GitHub)

      # fails if the analyzer finds errors (e.g. unused imports, type
      # issues).  Rules are defined in analysis_options.yaml.
